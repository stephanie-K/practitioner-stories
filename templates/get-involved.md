title: Get involved
---


With this project we really want to get the service design community involved and **we are always looking out for new ideas and stories!**

We’re currently at the point of reviewing our research and process to plan our next steps. 

<p>Read <a href="https://practitionerstories.medium.com/" target="_blank">our updates on Medium</a> if you would like to know more about what’s happening and how to get involved.</p>

We are curating the clusters of insights and will soon have smaller groups of insights you will be able to access and analyse further if you're interested. We will soon published the list here, and if some of them are interesting to you then you can get in touch and we will explain how you can get involved.


Please, don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have questions or ideas.
