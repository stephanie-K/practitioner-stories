title: Get involved
---


With this project we really want to get the service design community involved and **we are always looking out for new ideas and stories!**

## Who should get involved?

Anyone who is passionate about the service design practice in the public and third sector.

## Why?

- to learn from other practitioners
- build this design community
- shape the future of the service design practice
- experiment with the data
- network and meet more people
- share your own story


## How can you get involved?

We’re currently at the point of reviewing our research and process to plan our next steps. 

### Explore clusters of insights 

We are curating the clusters of insights to have smaller groups of insights you will be able to access and analyse further. We will published the list here, and if some of them are interesting to you then we will explain how you can get involved if you contact us.
<p><strong>This is a work in progress. <a href="https://twitter.com/Artmadillo" target="_blank">Get in touch with Angela</a> if this is something you would like to help us with.</strong></p>


### Use the data to run your own event

One of the biggest challenges we had faced with our first workshop was to balance the amount of data we had to give people the chance to deep dive but at the same time to not overwhelm them. We had spent a lot of time preparing this workshop and had created many different activities, which we weren‘t able to cover all. However, they could be useful to others and be reused?


We’re now looking at ways to create a package that would allow people to run their own events/workshops. We’re not sure what form this will take just now, but it could consist of some templates and data?
