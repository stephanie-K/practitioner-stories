### Explore clusters of insights

### Use the data to run your own event

One of the biggest challenges we had faced with our first workshop was to balance the amount of data we had to give people the chance to deep dive but at the same time to not overwhelm them. We had spent a lot of time preparing this workshop and had created many different activities, which we weren‘t able to cover all. However, they could be useful to others and be reused?


We’re now looking at ways to create a package that would allow people to run their own events/workshops. We’re not sure what form this will take just now, but it could consist of some templates and data?
