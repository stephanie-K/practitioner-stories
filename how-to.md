title: How to use this website
---

We are working on providing summaries of insights and analysis to make is easier for anyone interesed in this research to read about it but also to use it to explore further (not ready yet - work in progress).

Initially, we used Medium Posts and Miro to share our findings. This website is an attempt to show them differently.
The functionalities are limited for now.

## 5 Themes

After the first phase of analysis, 5 themes emerged:

1. Service design work and contributions
2. Scottish Approach to Service Design (SAtSD)
3. Working with people
4. Skills and Learning
5. Service design community

For each theme, there are general findings and we have grouped the challenges seperately on Miro as well as the aspirations for the future.

We kept this same structure on the website so for each theme, there is an **Introduction** page, a **General** findings one, and one for **Challenges** and for the **Future**.

## Different level of detail

Within each theme, there are sub-themes and for each of them, you will find a list of insights. If you want to learn more about a specific one then select it if it has a triangle next to it: 
-  all the quotes from participants which support this insight will appear under it
- select again to close it

> We do realise it's still very complex, but this is a first step to make all our data more accessible.
>
> We are open to suggestions and welcome feedback. **Tell us what you want to see here and in what format**.
