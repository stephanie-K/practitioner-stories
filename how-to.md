title: How to use this website
---

We are working on providing summaries of insights and analysis to make is easier for anyone interesed in this research to read about it but also to use it to explore further (not ready yet - work in progress).

Initially, we used Medium Posts and Miro to share our findings. This website is an attempt to show them differently.
The functionalities are limited for now.

## 5 Themes

After the first phase of analysis, 5 themes emerged:

1. Service design work and contributions
2. Scottish Approach to Service Design (SAtSD)
3. Working with people
4. Skills and Learning
5. Service design community

For each theme, there are general findings and we have grouped the challenges seperately on Miro as well as the aspirations for the future.

![diagram illustrating how our data is structured on Miro](/practitioner-stories/images/categories.png)

We kept this same structure on the website so for each theme, there is an **Introduction** page from where you can find:
- the **General** findings
- the  **Challenges**
- the aspirations for the  **Future**


## Different level of detail

Within each theme, there are sub-themes and for each of them, you will find a list of clusters of insights. 

If you want to learn more about a specific one then select it if it has a triangle next to it: 
- all the quotes from participants which support this cluster of insight will appear under it
- select again to close it

> We do realise it's still very complex, but this is a first step to make all our data more accessible and the analysis is not finished yet
>
> We are open to suggestions and welcome feedback.
