title: How to use this website
---

We are working on providing summaries of insights and analysis to make is easier for anyone interesed in this research to read about it but also to use it to explore further (not ready yet - work in progress).

Initially, we used Medium Posts and Miro to share our research. **This website is an attempt to show it differently**.
The functionalities are limited for now.

## 5 Themes

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">After the first phase of analysis, 5 themes emerged:</p>
1. Service design work and contributions
2. Scottish Approach to Service Design (SAtSD)
3. Working with people
4. Skills and Learning
5. Service design community

For each theme, there are general insights and we have grouped the challenges seperately on Miro as well as the aspirations for the future.

## Explore a theme

In the navigation menu you can select a theme. You then land on the introduction page for it. From there, you can access the other pages: General, Challenges and Future.

## Different level of detail

Within each theme, there are sub-themes and for each of them, you will find a list of clusters of insights. 

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">If you want to learn more about a specific one then select it if it has a triangle next to it: </p>
- all the quotes from participants which support this cluster of insights will appear under it
- select again to close it

> We do realise it's still very complex, but **this is a first step** to make all our data more accessible and the analysis is not finished yet.

> We are open to suggestions and welcome feedback.
