### SD practice not open for everyone

 <details>
 <summary>SD community being a privileged club</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>It could feel like a members-only-club</li>
    <li>And being aware that we‘re so white and privileged that‘s just the service design community. So, who else is developing this?  It almost seems like I’ve worked in a massive design bubble. And then I speak with people and they say yeah design is such a big bubble</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>Difficult getting your foot into service design</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>I can see how it can feel difficult for people, who can see its value but not knowing where to start. I feel like that‘s a question that is asked quite a lot. Like how do I begin doing this? If I would start with one tool or if I would introduce this to my team, how would I go about doing that?</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>How we hire people</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>I think we‘ve got work to do in terms of how we hire people for design positions. Our design groups and teams have a very similar look and background and level of privilege. So, I think we‘ve got work to do to diversify that. Especially people like myself, who are working in the public sector, need to produce services for our population, so we can do that best by including people within the teams, who are representatives of that population. And I don’t think we‘re quite doing that yet. So, that‘s another area I would like to work into</li>

### Lack of inclusivity in SD practice

 <details>
 <summary>Who designs services?</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>I think there are barriers in terms of how people perceive themselves to be a person, who designs services. And how that can be part of your role if not the whole of your role. I think that would be an exciting thing to explore</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>Bias, accessibility and social justice</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>I am really interested in that complexity around bias and inequity, social justice in a service design space, and specially in the public and third sectors. And we don’t yet have the... at least not in the... like the SAtSD, doesn’t catch on that. Because it can’t, it’s not at that level of conversation yet</li>
    <li>Yeah that so flipping that around [what accessiblity bring to SD] probably the answer is: not enough? but where I would like to be doing more, where I would like to see an opportunity is for more of that thinking around diverse needs, trying to encourage and support and understanding what the experience of disabled people and people with health conditions is, so what's their lived experience and how do you ensure that this is considered as part of your design process even if you can't get them into the room</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>SD practice needs to become more inclusive and diverse</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Yes we need [service design] skills, but going back to my point, you should have lots of different people in the team. And you know, service design, I don’t find it as inclusive to like user research sometimes. They should be intermingled in with everything</li>
    <li>What about booking a holiday, someone who uses a screen reader, can they do that? what do you mean? Can a colleague who uses a screen reader book a holiday? oh I don't know I haven't a clue... hmm ok fine, so why are we not thinking about those kinds of things as well? Now to be fair, we are [thinking about it] to an extent, but whether or not we have the knowledge in the right places is a different matter</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>Activities and workshops not accessible</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>There are massive challenges getting disabled people into a room, playing with post it notes or whatever it happens to be, that is a big challenge, so yeah, being able to provide answers and support and understanding to help that, to ease that, that's where I would see I can make a difference</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>Involving the right people</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Where it‘s in fact, we know that those are the interesting people, the ones that do try out and do a bit of it while still doing their full-time job which is like answering the phones to citizens. They are the people, that are going to know what the service needs to be</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>Missing a set of principle s for inclusive design</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>We would need to somewhere say: these are our principles of inclusive design, this is what we mean when we are saying inclusive design. And there are a variety of principles and models around inclusive design on the intra-web, in many cases, it's probably not a case of writing from scratch, more like grabbing one, sticking a saltire on it and saying this is how we think about inclusive design. We might adapt it slightly, but  there is something in there that we need to talk about. Now inclusive design, there are lots of ways to think about that, I know that [...] is kind of involved in projects which are looking at inclusive methodologies, and there is a bit of high level piece on inclusive design but it's just  how are articulating that and how clear it is, what were doing in that place. I don't know that we are doing that great yet</li>
    <li>Inclusive design, designing in an inclusive manner. I think the challenge with that is that we haven't got a define model on how we are doing that or how we might approach that, everybody is winging it, now all the service designers I know are fine at that , they think about diverse needs, they think about it in diverse ways and they're open to trying out new things and that's exactly what you need but in terms of a kind of consistent... a set of principles around service design we don't necessarily articulate it that well, or pull that together in a way that all the designers might be thinking or pulling in the same direction</li>
 </ul>

### Missing discussion around ethics in SD

 <details>
 <summary>What are the inequities we are creating?</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>There is a lot of talk about Design Thinking being the master's tool. It's been created by certain people for certain people really. What is it that we are hard coding by replicating some kind of practice for example? What are the inequities that we are creating and reinforcing in the things that we are designing because we haven't thought about the origins of it or we haven't thought about our own team bias? These conversations can be directly applied even though they are not about a technical development. Because these ideas have come from somewhere, and we are using them. So what is in this thing that I'm using that was developed by these people that might be excluding these people and how can I modify that to be more accessible, to be more inclusive?</li>
    <li> The Design Justice Network is a global network looking at social justice within design, and how designers can be aware of the decisions that they are making especially around reinforcing power structure or inequity.</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>Need to up-skill service designers to be more critical</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>There’s a huge upskilling need across the community to really think critically about the processes and to be aware of.... You know, we talk about designing for good and there is this kind of real optimistic positive energy around changing the world. And that is really positive, but it needs to be grounded in reality</li>

 <details>
 <summary>Giving ownership to the communities</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>We've got a community empowerment act, and I think it is that thing. I was at a community council for a project, and I asked the question: "who gets to keep the bits and pieces once it's don?", and they said, "oh, you know, it's 'the plan', so that would be the council?". So that's my thing. Community should be the client, and I think the resource to get that. I think the power corrupts the thing. When you see the rhetoric on the health side as well,  there is lots of stories on how the lack of control on one's life is the greatest issue, so.. it's a long game, I think patience is the key,  patience and persistence as I used to say to folks, you know, community is not going away, communities will shift and change, the new generation is more open minded to things, its more about management structure, easing that power. There is an opportunity to really make a leap rather than incremental</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>Capacity building of communities</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>The community retains a lot of that information, that research as well. So they can then use it to build an understanding of their place and what they want to do. There is a lack of that. It seems to be held by others, and you need to make either an FOI request, you never know who to ask, or it's in different spaces. So I think now a common good knowledge bank for core information that will  help the community, if they want to do something they can tap into that, and  use that information, even if it's just a contact base or just previous stuff, it's your starting point to sort of build on</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>SD parachuting into communities</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>It just seemed very weighted on the side of the design team and the organisation that was commissioning the research or the design; and that is still a huge gap. I don't know of any team - and especially public services - where there are a lot of discussions going on about the inclusivity or not of what we do. Because of the way we do it and the way we approach communities and citizens, the way we organise these relationships - where we should have been nurturing relationships with people this whole time, we haven't been. So what does it feel like to parachute in XYZ communities and do your cute research workshop? So these conversations were not happening, it was so obvious to me when I got in the SD space. I don't know that I would have that experience in previous roles that are community based or even more community led or more participatory. That still a huge thing for me</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 <details>
 <summary>Think they don't need to talk to people</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Assuming that you know stuff and don't need to talk to people, which I know, is the opposite of service design ethos but I do think that occasionally you come across people that may be are kind of comfortable with skipping over the user part of things</li>
 </ul>
