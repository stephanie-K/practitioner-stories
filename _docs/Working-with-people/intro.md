## How the data is grouped
- [General findings](/practitioner-stories/Working-with-people/general) (**Not ready yet**)
- [Challenges](/practitioner-stories/Working-with-people/challenges) (**Not ready yet**)
- [Future and aspirations](/practitioner-stories/Working-with-people/future) (**Not ready yet**)

Note that a lot of findings are related to another theme "[SAtSD](/practitioner-stories/SAtSD/intro)". It's not surprising, this is the aim of the approach. There is also some overlap with "[SD work and contribution](/practitioner-stories/SD-work-contributions/intro)".
