 <summary>Learning reflection</summary>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Short term goals:</strong> I‘m definitely more of a short-term goal type of person. I‘ve also struggled to say that is where I want to be in five years’ time, or this is want I want to be doing even this time next year. Because I always write quite a broad statement and then I find it difficult to know what to attach to it</li>
    <li><strong>Start with how you want to do things differently:</strong> What I found more helpful for me is to start each project or each phase of a project with an intention of how I want to work differently. Tools I want to try out or a method of presenting I saw someone else doing or a way of telling a story and involving the team in. I give myself shorter periods of time to do that. I found this helpful in terms of feeling that I‘m also trying different things out and that I‘m always growing.</li>
    <li>I don't even know where to start. I have a long list</li>

##### Distinction from other disciplines
 <details>
 <summary>SD are not very different to other roles</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Actually the things we consider like the skills that sets up a service designer, that sets us apart from other designers or other public sector people, civil servants, is actually quite a small part of what the role actually is</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Tensions to other disciplines</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>There are so many other people, that you work alongside, who do very similar things. Working alongside business analysts, or working alongside product owners, that actually you can get a little bit tangle in terms of what your job role is.</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
 <br>

##### Expected to be super heroes (have the whole skills set)
  <details>
 <summary>Context dependant</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>[The skills needed of the designer] depend on the project. Should be recruiting designers to roles based on what is needed</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Different designers, different contributions (details view of process vs very high level)</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>I don’t tend to do well in the micro-detail process of a services, it’s more on the big goal. I joined a few boards so I could actually build my confidence, expertise, and seeing more 50000 feet rather than 10 feet</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Don't have the whole skillset is good as you can be challenge by those who have different skills</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>The key thing is that you put designers with a team that maybe have those skills anyway, and then it’s peer support, [...] often, we are put out there on our own, but one person does not have this whole skillset. And we shouldn't do, because innovation comes when you are challenged by other people's perspectives</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>It should be ok not to know</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Retain that kind of naivete and that kind of neutrality that we go in and ask stupid questions. We shouldn’t have all the skills and solutionising at that initial stage</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
 <br>

 ##### Gradient from: "anyone can do SD after a 1/2 training session" up to: "you need a masters plus years of experience"
  <details>
 <summary>Some think only experts can do Service design</summary>
 <ul>
    <li> I find designers who have been doing it for a long time or have a big name for themselves are very skeptical about other people doing design. I think I'm on the fence. Because if you talk to someone like that, [...] they think it's bad that other people are doing design because they are not experts in it and it dilutes the quality  I think it's just wrong when you hear... it's almost like a head chef mentality that "only I can do this, and nobody else can do this". That's my general view of how design has changed. We have got better at implementing it within businesses and  charities. We should not really be scared that it's becoming more common knowledge.</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Wrong image of what the skills of a SD are</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>you get this picture that a service designer is a person, who either does research themselves or works with researchers, produces a hell lot of personas and journeys maps and diagrams and then maybe makes some prototypes of varying degree of fidelity and then probably makes something like a blueprint. We educate ourselves that it is our job to make things and you produce diagrams. So, we‘re seeing a lot of people coming out of university being able to produce really nice diagrams. And one of the things I‘m reflecting on in these conversations is that this is such a small percentage of the job</li>
 </ul>

### How we facilitate, tell the story, take people on the journey

There is something here about the way we learn about the people we work with and how to engage them and take them on the journey.

#### List of clusters of insights

  ##### Facilitation skills
  This is mentioned in learning as well as a lot of participants realised they needed to improve this skill.
 
 <details>
 <summary>Importance of facilitation skills</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>When you‘re working to design services, although that are the words within your job title, there are so many other people that you‘re working with, negotiating with, collecting pieces of information from, and kind of stich it all together. So much more of your time is spend coordinating that and facilitating that. So, I think, more than 50% of my time is spend facilitating in my job. It‘s either encouraging other people, or prompting at other people, or putting stuff in front of other people that‘s wrong so that they can make it more right. So, they can do the designing</li>
    <li>I am working on facilitation skills at the moment, that's good</li>
    <li>the most important set of skills and knowledge are about facilitation. How to take 30, 40 people through a process of learning so that they can support each other on that, that involves a completely different set of skills and knowledge.</li>
    <li>You have to be a good facilitator</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Facilitating workshop</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Learning how to conduct workshops, planning for workshops to make them both exciting and engaging for people. The worst thing you want to do is to spend a whole day with people and they leave totally de-energised and totally unexciting about the thing you were talking about. So how do you create material and events that actually engage people? All of this contributes to be a good facilitator</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Facilitation is also fundamental to creative leadership</summary>
 <ul>
    <li> I think that it's not only fundamental to design practice but also to creative leadership in organisations. So that’s a whole other set of skills</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Marrying public and 3rd sector perspective so they are focussed one 1 project or outcome</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>I have found that [having worked] with public and third sector, and being able to share... be a conjugate to those two perspectives has been really positive, and kind of allowed them to be in the same room together if they are focused on a project or kind of outcome. It i massively complicated</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 ##### Storytelling for engagement
 
 <details>
 <summary>People don't know how to tell a story</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>I don’t think people know how to tell stories, I don’t think they know what is a good story necessarily.</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Learning to use text and pictures to tell a story in social media and engage</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>I think getting to that bit Where people are just saying look This is a problem we had in this context, here is what it looks like and this is what we did... I just think that would be really... it’s a really good place to encourage people to get to</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Learning how to use metaphors and you need to be able to story tell them</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>What I've learnt is that I didn't have that thing of a storyteller and an understanding of the power of a story on social media. It's how to do engagement differently, very much looking at the lived experienced sort of case studies, ideas and using it. How people consume content in a graphical way, a bit of text and a picture, so looking at this just now</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 ##### Stakeholder engagement / Reality check
 
 <details>
 <summary>Learn to compromise, reality and stakeholder to take into account</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Simple things like stakeholder management, understanding... there’s a reality some times  you have to learn more about other disciplines and about other ways of working. I think your ideas come along more complex, and you learn how to compromise a lot more</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Get the balance between your vision and ideal and what you can implement practically</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>You know, it’s not straight forward to change the world, and actually there are lots of things you need to influence. So just creating a nice vision isn’t gonna do it. So we need to be more effective at creating idealistic and visionary, but also practical. Things that can be changed and implemented. As much as I love reimagining how certain things could work, it is how you balance that with all these other things</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
<br>

 ##### Other:

  <details>
 <summary>Building relationships / listening and dialog, learning how to engage with people who are not familiar to SD</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>How people have conversations, dialogs, interactions, how relationships are built. I think sometimes that skill isn't there, especially if researchers and designers are coming to an existing culture. That culture might include technical teams, very senior people. If that softer ability to descend well, or to have the simple conversations, or to get into really challenging research findings; if that skill isn't there, it just hurts everybody and it's probably a waste of money in the end. So there is this skill about listening and dialog in that, especially if design is new. [...]</li>
    <li>Many public services, especially are commissioning service design and service designers that are definitely not ready to be challenged, so this is back to the readiness</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Learn about the organisation and then go and make an argument</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Learn all the materials and organisations, get yourself in the position of having to be in a meeting and make an argument. Go and put yourself in a position of looking at how something got made. And I think, that for me is probably what’s missing in terms of skillset. [...] That stuff and full stack staff, being able to make things happen in an organisation is really important</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Understanding power & politics - the power relationship you are working within</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Design is about politics, about power, right? Power: how does it work? how is it exercised?  why does some people have it,  and some people don't have it?  An understanding of power  leads to to an understanding of a lot of other things like privilege and so forth. And that is really really important, so that  designers understand the Power relationships they are working within, the dimensions of power but they exercise themselves and the need for empower others</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Theatrical method: using a structure, dramatic arches in everything you do to engage people</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>3 days in terms of learning loads of things about theoretical methods but also about dramatic arches - which we hadn’t really thought of in terms of facilitation. And we have a started to apply that to everything we do. Because when you go to an event,  go to an online event, go to a conference; part of your brain is expecting a movie, that same dramatic arc. It has to reach a climax point,  it can't be a climate all the way through, You have to have a structure through it. But also you want something at the end  that  hosts people down. And understanding that from [the workshop] was hugely insightful, and how that helps people to learn. So, if  there's something else that I would add, a ll designers need to learn about - it's not only politics, It's about theatrical method, cause that's how you engage with people and how you help people engage with others</li>
 </ul>

 <details>
 <summary>Working in a team - build together - collaborate</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Learning how to work in a team and how to build ideas together and build up other people‘s ideas</li>
    <li>Generally I am pretty good at team working and pretty good at collaborating. I don’t think I hold space too heavily. I am quite open to how people think they should be working or what they should be doing. Team working is not an issue</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Craft making / craft thinking so you look at the world in a different way</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Craft practice actually gives you a distinctive learning that can be applied in different ways. There are many brilliant service designers who have a background in textiles or jewellery. Craft learning gives you an approach to looking at the world in a very different way. [My interest was in] how do you get that very distinctive mentality and way of looking at the world when you put that in a different contexts</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Curating information - where you choose to have your information</summary>

 <p><strong>This links with - too many events - too many things out there - SD is a field that forces you to have a wide set of skills to and learn from a lot of sources</strong></p>
 <ul>
    <li>I think the sparks for things that I then go and read, or watch or listen to, 95% of times comes from these Slacks things or Twitter and I've done a bit of an audit of my Twitter, the information I'm receiving is much different now than it was last year. There is something in that as well, where do we choose to receive our information and what benefit we would have coming outside of Service Design so we get other areas.</li>
    <li>There is so much going on just now, we are trying to refine that, it's a bit like when you do a desktop research, you can narrow it down, I've got my themes focussing on what I'm hearing, set to reflect a little bit and then say right ok, what question should we be asking etc... that's the way I do</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Using patterns as an approach</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>I see a lot of different organisations in the internet having those kind of pattern libraries, but it’s something I’m not completely sure how to get there.  I think the way we get trained as service designers and generally talk about our work tends to be stuck in an agency model where you don’t necessarily have that option. YOu just... you are a consultant. You have a set of tools, you work with people to sort of fill them in, and then produce something, more or less finished in the end, and then push it out</li>
    <li>I am really interested in patterns as an approach,  so i would like to which stage  where Someone in [ my organisation] says, ‘this is an outpatient clinic that sees this many people a year, that I have an idea of what patterns we have in relation to outpatient cliniques and things like that</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>The soft skills</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>So many people come for interviews, so talented, ah, they are so good, but they spent four years in university, and now because service design has evolved, and that’s why I call it the de-evolution I actually prefer meeting people from product design, architecture, and again, not everyone needs to come from a design background</li>
    <li>That’s an important distinction to make. We have lots of people who are not designers, but in a design context, [...] at a more junior level in the business, they are just really switched on and maybe worked part-time or worked in a bar while they were at Uni, or at a coffee shop and they get it</li>
 </ul>

 <details>
 <summary>SD should be in the curriculum for anyone as an approach about how you think</summary>
 <ul>
    <li> I think design led approaches to things should be part of the curriculum and in terms of academia, how people learn about SD and not necessarily to be a Service designer but more like that may not be your job, but it's an approach about how you think about things</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
     <details>
 <summary>Too many expectations</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>We are expecting people to come out of service design courses within the universities after either a couple of years learning about design history and design as a process and map it or doing it as a one or two year masters at the end of something else</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
  <details>
 <summary>How: a lot of people coming through the same route (2 years of uni or SD courses)</summary>
 <ul>
    <li> A lot of people arriving in service design have come through the same route [service design courses within the universities after either a couple of years]</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
   <details>
 <summary>How: put yourself in a position of looking at how something got made and make it better</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>to most people I say ‘ditch the Masters and just go and work in a business and make it something better. Learn all the materials and organisations, get yourself in the position of having to be in a meeting and make an argument. Go and put yourself in a position of looking at how something got made. And I think, that for me is probably what’s missing in terms of skillset</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
   <details>
 <summary>How: self directed learning</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>My Masters’ degree was self-taught and self-developed</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
   <details>
 <summary>How: no need for a masters</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>Where do you find designers, because there is a growing demand for them, but is academia actually filling that demand, and where are they coming from, I suppose what skills should you have? does it really matter if you have a service design degree or is it more about how you think as a person. So from an academic point of view what does that mean? I think it's a whole other conversation though</li>
    <li> I advice people that say ‘how do I get into service design’ if they are doing a career change or trying to get into it from another discipline. Lot’s of people look at very expensive Masters courses. And I have to be careful what I say, because I really respect [that kind of training]. But going to a Masters if you want, you need the time in your life to go and do some introspective thinking and get over your impostor syndrome</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
   <details>
 <summary>Who: open up to diverse people not keeping a very straight, privilege white line of people coming to SD</summary>
 <ul>
    <li>you trained your brain to think in different ways and then brought this different thinking into this discipline, makes you kind of magical in terms of how you can approach a problem. And I was like, why are we not doing this within the design industry? Why are we expecting people to go through the same pipeline and then come out different, come out as diverse as we need? We're not going to answer that question by maintaining a very privileged, very white pipeline of designers. We‘re not going to answer that</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
    <details>
 <summary>Who: bringing in different people with different background,lived experience </summary>
 <ul>
    <li>All of those people coming into design jobs from other jobs, who previously been project managers, or musicians or other types of designers, all those people, who have fascinating brains and fascinating ways of walking through problems and telling stories, and people with lived experiences of the services, that we are designing, those are the people that I would love to see doing the job. Because I think they are more interesting than art school students</li>
