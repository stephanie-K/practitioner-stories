# In details: What the SAtSD means to practitioners


## Why specifically Scottish?
- Why is there the SAtSD? Why isn’t it just service design? It needs to be sold to me that there should be a special Scottish way
- Colleagues in [...] different places talk about the approach of Scottish design. It's just about service design
- I quite often hear ‘well, why is it Scottish approach, why is it different to service design?’
- Does Scotland want to be different? Are they setting themselves out to be different? And then failing at being different

## A brand, a product
- it's an approach that has been packaged up along with resources and assets to codify and standardise practice, so to me it's a product and a brand [...] it feels like it's a brand that's been promoted.

## Scotland: SD school & army
- it gives the impression that design is over here, and that we are building an army of designers to be the biggest design school in the world. So for that reason again, it feels like it's a brand that's been promoted.
- we have this ambition about Scotland being almost like a design school and, you know, people being equipped with the skills to understand what is expected of them and how they can participate.

## A vision or a promise of meaningful involvement
- Service design is everybody’s business. [...] we sometimes present SD as if it is just for the cool kids. It is not, it is for everybody, it is for every citizen. You know, that right to co-design or at least to influence, to have a say on the services that you as a citizen receive; that right to help determine how those work, that's what it means to me
- it's almost like a kind of promise I suppose, from Scottish Government about taking a citizen-led approach about how they design their services. So kind of like putting a stake in the ground and saying: "that's how we want to work, this is the approach that we would like to take and this is our promise to put the citizens at the centre of how we do public services"
- an idea and a principle which encourages people to ensure that they are not designing in their own heads, that they are taking that design out of their own heads and that they are pushing away from them. For me the big part of it is "where is the power in any design activity?" if the power is with you as a designer, as a researcher, as a content or service designer, then it's in the wrong place. Now that's not to say that specialist skills should not be there but we should try to push the power out to the actual service users and giving and encouraging them ways to engage with us more effectively
- what I take from SAtSD, that's the hope for me, that it will become more ingrained across national and local government and 3rd sector. [...] for me it's going to be core competence: if your organisation is not doing this then you are missing out. and it's been quite proven that organisations if they do this, they get better.
- the Scottish approach is very much around trying to actively encourage us to get people into the room as much as possible, it's very easy to kind of forget, to do the primary research with some people, [...] but then when we get to the design process, they're out, we're the specialists, we know what we are doing, we're going to come up with this and there you go! it's forgotten. And I think that's where we're slightly different, I'm not saying we're unique, there are  places around the world that do that stuff, and do it well, but trying to make that a key part of the design, that's probably a bit more unique.
- What SAtSD means to me and why it is different to Service Design practice is that it is about inclusion and about being inclusive in its approach and how services are design and the process. So it is not just designing a service in a person-centred test, in a way, it’s about making sure that people can be involved inclusively in the design and delivery.

## People are talking about it
- I have talked to [people] in Wales who are doing a bit of this work.
- I think it's landed well and when I speak to colleagues in London, and Manchester and different places they will talk about the approach of Scottish Design [...] They've heard about it potentially at conferences like SDinGov, some other work like Snook and some big authorities, [...] but also through the Scottish Government's own website and I know it's easy to access.


## Setting expectations
- people from other countries look at it and they are like what‘s Scotland is doing is different. But it‘s not. And then, it kind of draws weird glances to be like: "does Scotland want to be different? Are they setting themselves out to be different? And then failing at being different. It sets weird expectations, I think.
