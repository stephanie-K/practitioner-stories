Participants might have also mentioned it while answering other questions.

We spoke with practitioners who had different degrees of awareness about the Scottish Approach to Service Design (SAtSD).

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">Some of them had:</p>
- contributed to its development to varying degrees
- practical experience using it with public and third sector organisations
- heard about it but have not engaged with it or 'have struggled to understand what it is'

<blockquote>
<p> "When we started this, we just called it The Scottish Approach to Service Design, because civil servants in Scottish government had a philosophy called the Scottish Approach to Government and I was trying to explain to them why design connected to how they thought, so I connected the two things and it stuck." - Cat Macaulay</p>
