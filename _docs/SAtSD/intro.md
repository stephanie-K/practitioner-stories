> We called it the SAtSD because civil servants in Scottish Government had a philosophy called the Scottish Approach to Government', and I was trying to explain to them why design connected to how they thought. - Cat Macaulay

## Question which generated the data
<blockquote class="alt">
<p>Have you heard of the Scottish Approach to Service Design? And if so, what does it mean to you?</p>
</blockquote>

Participants might have also mentioned it while answering other questions.

## How the data is grouped
- [general findings](/practitioner-stories/SAtSD/general)
- [challenges](/practitioner-stories/SAtSD/challenges)
- [future and aspirations](/practitioner-stories/SAtSD/future)

Note that a lot of findings are related to another theme "[Working with people](/practitioner-stories/Working-with-people/intro)". It's not surprising, this is the aim of the approach.
