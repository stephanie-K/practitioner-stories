title: Who we are
---


We are four service designers living and working in Scotland passionate about our practice and with the aim of bringing the service design community together by sharing experiences and learnings and discussing the future.

We were initially three, but Vinishree joined later when we opened up to others when we started the analysis phase.

You can get in touch with us individually on the Service Design in Scotland Slack for example or the Public Sector Design in Scotland Slack, on Twitter or LinkedIn.
