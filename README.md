# Practitioner Stories

## What the project is about
[This project started with a tweet in June 2020](https://medium.com/@angelaforviz/remember-that-tweet-8b36dbae82bc). We teamed up to collect stories of Service Design in the public and third sectors in Scotland. We started an interview study and discussed with 15 practitioners in Scotland **how we can better support, grow and build up the service design community in Scotland**.

## Who we are
We are 3 service designers living and working in Scotland passionate about our practice and with the aim of bringing the service design community together by sharing experiences and learnings and discussing the future.

**Note: we are doing this on our personal time and have no funding.**

## Sharing our research

This is a website is being built to share the research we did. **Under contruction**

This is using Github pages, Jekyll and CloudCannon. By using some markdown language, you can create content which is deployed in the next 2 to 5 min to a website. No hosting needed and it's free.

* Documentation pages are organised in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.

### Change log

* Tag entries as minor or major in the front matter.

### Search

* Add `excluded_in_search: true` to any documentation page's front matter to exclude that page in the search results.

### Navigation

* Change `site.show_full_navigation` to control all or only the current navigation group being open.
